# Exam_4

Created a python script to find the number of possible and observed kmers for a specifc sequence. 
First created a function called p_kmers to calculate the number of possible kmers and return the count.
Then created the function o_kmers to find the observed kmers count and to make sure they were unique.
Made a function called dataframe to create a dataframe using the columns k, observed kmers and possible kmers and added data according to each column.
Made a function called linguistic_comp to do the calculation to find the linguistic complexity of the sequence
Lastly created a main function to use all of the others and read in the desired sequence that could be called to print the outcome.
